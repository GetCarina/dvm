Legacy PEM encryption as\r\n  specified in RFC 1423 is insecure by design. Because it does not authenticate\r\n  the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an\r\n  attacker recover the plaintext.

When\nupgrading from an older version of docker, the upgrade process may not\nautomatically install the updated version of the unit file, or fail to start\nthe docker service if;\n- the systemd unit file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`) contains local changes, or\n- a systemd drop-in file is present, and contains `-H fd://` in the `ExecStart` directive\n\nStarting the docker service will produce an error:\n\n```\nFailed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nno sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.\n```\n\nTo resolve this:\n- Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the\n  [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)\n- Remove the `Requires=docker.socket` directive from the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` file if present\n- Remove `-H fd://` from the `ExecStart` directive (both in the main unit file, and in any drop-in files present).\n\nAfter making those changes, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and `sudo\nsystemctl restart docker` to reload changes and (re)start the docker daemon.\n\n**NOTE**: Docker 1.12.6 will correctly validate that either an IPv6 subnet is provided or\nthat the IPAM driver can provide one when you specify the `--ipv6` option.\n\nIf you are currently using the `--ipv6` option _without_ specifying the\n`--fixed-cidr-v6` option, the Docker daemon will refuse to start with the\nfollowing message:\n\n``` none\nError starting daemon: Error initializing network controller: Error creating\n                       default \"bridge\" network: failed to parse pool request\n                       for address space \"LocalDefault\" pool \" subpool \":\n                       could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv6 address\n                       pool among the defaults to assign to the network\n```\n\nTo resolve this error, either remove the `--ipv6` flag (to preserve the same\nbehavior as in Docker 1.12.3 and earlier), or provide an IPv6 subnet as the\nvalue of the `--fixed-cidr-v6` flag.\n\nIn a similar way, if you specify the `--ipv6` flag when creating a network\nwith the default IPAM driver, without providing an IPv6 `--subnet`, network\ncreation will fail with the following message:\n\n``` none\nError response from daemon: failed to parse pool request for address space\n                            \"LocalDefault\" pool \"\" subpool \"\": could not find an\n                            available, non-overlapping IPv6 address pool among\n                            the defaults to assign to the network\n```\n\nTo resolve this, either remove the `--ipv6` flag (to preserve the same behavior\nas in Docker 1.12.3 and earlier), or provide an IPv6 subnet as the value of the\n`--subnet` flag.\n\nThe network network creation will instead succeed if you use an external IPAM driver\nwhich supports automatic allocation of IPv6 subnets.\n\n### Runtime\n- Fix runC privilege escalation

1.13.0 (2017-01-10)\n\n**IMPORTANT**: In Docker 1.13, the managed plugin api changed, as compared to the experimental\nversion introduced in Docker 1.12. You must **uninstall** plugins which you installed with Docker 1.12\n_before_ upgrading to Docker 1.13. You can uninstall plugins using the `docker plugin rm` command.\n\nIf you have already upgraded to Docker 1.13 without uninstalling\npreviously-installed plugins, you may see this message when the Docker daemon\nstarts:\n\n```\nError starting daemon: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type types.PluginEnv\n```\n\nTo manually remove all plugins and resolve this problem, take the following steps:\n1. Remove plugins.json from: `/var/lib/docker/plugins/`.\n2. Restart Docker. Verify that the Docker daemon starts with no errors.\n3. Reinstall your plugins.\n\n### Builder\n- Add capability to specify images used as a cache source on build.

When\nupgrading from an older version of docker, the upgrade process may not\nautomatically install the updated version of the unit file, or fail to start\nthe docker service if;\n- the systemd unit file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`) contains local changes, or\n- a systemd drop-in file is present, and contains `-H fd://` in the `ExecStart` directive\n\nStarting the docker service will produce an error:\n\n```\nFailed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nno sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.\n```\n\nTo resolve this:\n- Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the\n  [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)\n- Remove the `Requires=docker.socket` directive from the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` file if present\n- Remove `-H fd://` from the `ExecStart` directive (both in the main unit file, and in any drop-in files present).\n\nAfter making those changes, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and `sudo\nsystemctl restart docker` to reload changes and (re)start the docker daemon.\n\n**NOTE**: Docker 1.12.5 will correctly validate that either an IPv6 subnet is provided or\nthat the IPAM driver can provide one when you specify the `--ipv6` option.\n\nIf you are currently using the `--ipv6` option _without_ specifying the\n`--fixed-cidr-v6` option, the Docker daemon will refuse to start with the\nfollowing message:\n\n``` none\nError starting daemon: Error initializing network controller: Error creating\n                       default

IPv6 address\n                       pool among the defaults to assign to the network\n```\n\nTo resolve this error, either remove the `--ipv6` flag (to preserve the same\nbehavior as in Docker 1.12.3 and earlier), or provide an IPv6 subnet as the\nvalue of the `--fixed-cidr-v6` flag.\n\nIn a similar way, if you specify the `--ipv6` flag when creating a network\nwith the default IPAM driver, without providing an IPv6 `--subnet`, network\ncreation will fail with the following message:\n\n``` none\nError response from daemon: failed to parse pool request for address space\n

to the network\n```\n\nTo resolve this, either remove the `--ipv6` flag (to preserve the same behavior\nas in Docker 1.12.3 and earlier), or provide an IPv6 subnet as the value of the\n`--subnet` flag.\n\nThe network network creation will instead succeed if you use an external IPAM driver\nwhich supports automatic allocation of IPv6 subnets.\n\n### Runtime\n- Fix race on sending stdin close

1.12.1 (2016-08-16)\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Docker 1.12 ships with an updated systemd unit file for rpm\nbased installs (which includes RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7). When\nupgrading from an older version of docker, the upgrade process may not\nautomatically install the updated version of the unit file, or fail to start\nthe docker service if;\n- the systemd unit file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`) contains local changes, or\n- a systemd drop-in file is present, and contains `-H fd://` in the `ExecStart` directive\n\nStarting the docker service will produce an error:\n\n```\nFailed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nno sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.\n```\n\nTo resolve this:\n- Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the\n  [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)\n- Remove the `Requires=docker.socket` directive from the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` file if present\n- Remove `-H fd://` from the `ExecStart` directive (both in the main unit file, and in any drop-in files present).\n\nAfter making those

the highlights and more detail on what's new in this release, check out the blog post](https://blog.docker.com/2016/02/docker-1-10/)\n\n# Changelog\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Docker 1.10 uses a new content-addressable storage for images and layers.\nA migration is performed the first time docker is run, and can take a significant amount of time depending on the number of images present.\nRefer to this page on the wiki for more information: https://github.com/docker/docker/wiki/Engine-v1.10.0-content-addressability-migration\nWe also released a cool migration utility that enables you to perform the migration before updating to reduce downtime.\nEngine 1.10 migrator can be found on Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/v1.10-migrator/\n\n### Runtime\n- New `docker update` command that allows updating resource constraints on running containers [#15078](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/15078)\n- Add `--tmpfs` flag to `docker run` to create a tmpfs mount in a container [#13587](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/13587)\n- Add `--format` flag to `docker images` command [#17692](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17692)\n- Allow to set daemon configuration in a file and hot-reload it with the `SIGHUP` signal [#18587](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/18587)\n- Updated docker events to include more meta-data and event types [#18888](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/18888)\n  This change is backward compatible in the API, but not on the CLI.\n- Add `--blkio-weight-device` flag to `docker run` [#13959](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/13959)\n- Add `--device-read-bps` and `--device-write-bps` flags to `docker run` [#14466](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/14466)\n- Add

Change `docker run` exit codes to distinguish between runtime and application errors [#14012](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/14012)\n- Enhance `docker events --since` and `--until` to support nanoseconds and timezones [#17495](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17495)\n- Add `--all`/`-a` flag to `stats` to include both running and stopped containers [#16742](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/16742)\n- Change the default cgroup-driver to `cgroupfs` [#17704](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17704)\n- Emit a \"tag\" event when tagging an

[#18887](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/18887)\n  This is an optional, opt-in feature that requires the explicit use of the Notary command-line utility in order to be enabled.\n  Enabling delegation support in a specific repository will break the ability of Docker 1.9 and 1.8 to pull from that repository, if content trust is enabled.\n- Allow SELinux to run in a container when using the BTRFS storage driver [#16452](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/16452)\n\n### Distribution\n- Use content-addressable storage for images and layers [#17924](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17924)\n  Note that a migration is performed the first time docker is run; it can take a significant amount of time depending on the number of images and containers present.\n  Images no longer depend on the parent chain but contain a list of layer references.\n  `docker load`/`docker save` tarballs now also contain content-addressable image configurations.\n  For more information: https://github.com/docker/docker/wiki/Engine-v1.10.0-content-addressability-migration\n- Add support for the new [manifest format (\"schema2\")](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md) [#18785](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/18785)\n- Lots of improvements for push and pull:

[#19109](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/19109), [#18353](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/18353)\n- Limit v1 protocol fallbacks [#18590](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/18590)\n- Fix issue where docker could hang indefinitely waiting for a nonexistent process to pull an image [#19743](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/19743)\n\n### Networking\n- Use DNS-based discovery instead of `/etc/hosts` [#19198](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/19198)\n- Support for network-scoped alias using `--net-alias` on `run` and `--alias` on `network connect`
